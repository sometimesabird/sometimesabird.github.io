    <br>
    <strong>Study Number:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>IRB20-1438 (University of Chicago),&nbsp;IRB-AAAT2171 (Columbia
    University)<br>
    <strong>Researchers:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Mateusz Stalinski (University of Chicago), George

      <strong>Description</strong>: We are researchers at the University of Chicago and Columbia University interested
      in advertising on social media, to which end we created this survey. It will take approximately 5 minutes of your
      time. Your participation is voluntary.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Incentives</strong>: Within four weeks after completion of this survey you will participate in a lottery
      to
      win a $100-value Amazon gift card. We will randomly pick one winner from the pool of all participants. If you are
      victorious, we will contact you by email to communicate about transferring the card to you. The winner is
      responsible
      for any potential tax payments associated with the prize.<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <strong>Risks and Benefits</strong>:&nbsp;The risks to your participation in this online study are those
      associated
      with basic surveys including boredom, fatigue, mild stress, or breach of confidentiality. The benefit to society
      is
      the contribution to scientific knowledge. The University of Chicago and Columbia University will only use this
      data
      for research purposes.&nbsp;</div>

    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Identifiable data will be stored only in Qualtrics, Firebase (developed by
      Google),
      and UChicago Box which reduces the risk of a data breach. Identifiable information will never be shared outside
      the
      research team. Only de-identified information from this study may be used for future research studies or shared
      with
      other researchers for future research without your additional informed consent. If you decide to withdraw from the
      study at a later stage, please contact the research team at mstalinski@uchicago.edu, and we will immediately
      destroy
      any identifiable information related to your data. Your de-identified data may still be included in
      analysis.&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
